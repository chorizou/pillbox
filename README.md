# pillbox
A smart-pillbox that's linked to a phone app through bluetooth and opens containers throughout the day to remind patients, especially elderly ones, to take the correct amount of pills at the right times. A buzzer is included to give a sound reminder for elderly people who aren't familiar with using smart phones or those who don't check their phones often.
