# pillbox
A smart-pillbox that's linked to a phone app through bluetooth and opens the right containers at the right times throughout the day to remind patients, especially elderly ones, to take the right amount of pills at the right times. A buzzer is included to give a sound reminder for elderly people who aren't familiar with using smart phones or those who don't check their phones often.
